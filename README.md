# MouseController
MouseController is an Window application meant to give ease to people who both have limited USB ports on their computer as well as those who are simply lazy. The application allows for seamless use of a controller in place of a mouse and some important keyboard functionality.
Note: To use MouseController, you must ensure that your controller uses XInput. A simple Google search or checking the rear of your controller for a toggle switch on *X* as opposed to *D*.

## Feature Highlight
- All mouse functionality

- Media control using D-Pad
