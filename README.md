# MouseController
MouseController is an Window application meant to give ease to people who both have limited USB ports on their computer as well as those who are simply lazy. The application allows for seamless use of a controller in place of a mouse and some important keyboard functionality. With a funky bind to re-enable and disable the application, it can seamlessly coexist as you go in and out of games, giving you control over your mouse as you wish. The application lives in your taskbar tray and can be closed with a simple right-click and quit.

*Note: To use MouseController, you must ensure that your controller uses XInput. A simple Google search or checking the rear of your controller for a toggle switch on **X** as opposed to **D** will show the type. As DirectInput is deprecated, support will not be included.*

## Feature Highlight
- Different polling periods when app is on vs not to reduce CPU consumption and avoid accidental re-enables
- All major mouse functionality, **excluding interaction with always-on-top programs**
- Task view to quickly swap tabs in place of alt-tab, which can be navigated with controller bumpers
- Media control using D-Pad allows to control music for when things get intense
- Sensitivity can be changed using the menu from the tray icon
